- get the issues in from tmp/
- add a version, real option handling and main
- add test suite
- handle html snippet by wrapping in <body> if not there already, to allow:
    markdown2 foo.md | simplehtml2rst > foo.rst
- fix those issues
- add real blockquote (drop the HARDWIRED from module and README.md)
- some solution for directives (I hope minidom exposes HTML comments)
- test against my corpus
